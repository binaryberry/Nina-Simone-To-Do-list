Nina Simone To Do list
=======================

## What is it?

A Nina Simone-themed To Do list app, using your browser's local storage to store the data. The site can play "Do what you gotta do" by Nina Simone as a jazzy encouragement.

## How was it built?

We were supplied the base Javascript code by our coach, and then had to use jQuery to allow tasks to be crossed off and then removed when the page was refreshed. Since I enjoyed the project and it kept making me thing of that Nina Simone song, I decided to make it a full site by adding a simple Node server, CSS and some music. That is my only non-TDD project!

- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Node.JS


## What did I learn?

- Using -nth lists in CSS to make different coloured blocks
- Building a simple Node server
- Using jQuery

## How do I see it in action?

Clone the repo, and from the project's directory run:
```
npm start
```
Then go to localhost:3000 in your browser.

I recommend adding up to 6 tasks to enjoy the full colour scheme. The tasks can be ticked off and will vanish when the page is refreshed.
